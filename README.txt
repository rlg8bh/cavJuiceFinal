This github contains files relating to the design and execution of the Cav Juice website.

The files include code to establish an "About Us" page, a "Contact Us" page, a "Login" sidebar, a "Sign-up" sidebar, and registering capability. There is also code to connect the Cav Juice website to the cav-juice database to store members' information.

We have chosen the design of Helios by HTML5, explained below:

Helios by HTML5 UP
html5up.net | @ajlkn
Free for personal and commercial use under the CCA 3.0 license (html5up.net/license)


This is Helios, a brand new site template for HTML5 UP. It's clean, modern, and designed
to take advantage of larger (well, wider) displays while still being capable of gracefully
scaling down to fit all manner of smaller ones.
